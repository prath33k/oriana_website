        Aren't you bored that all fests coduct battle of bands in the same way?
        Here at Oriana 2017 we redesigned battle of bands from scratch,
        a completely new approach that you've never ever heard of before.
        This is going to be a Royal Rumble where all the members of all the bands
        attack each other with their instruments. The band to which the last alive
        member belongs to will be declared as the winner.Posthumous awards won't
          be given to the dead members of the winning band.
